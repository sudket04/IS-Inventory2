   IS-Inventory v2 — 08: Indexes

   v1 had none of these: the only indexes in the whole database were the ones
   SQL Server creates for PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE. Foreign keys are NOT indexed
   automatically, so every "which servers are on this cluster?" and every
   cascade check was a table scan. That is survivable at 50 rows and not at
   the volume 30-100 people will produce.

   Uniqueness lives with its table in 02-06 (those filtered unique indexes are
   constraints, not tuning). Everything here is purely for speed and can be
   dropped and rebuilt without changing what the database means.

   Nearly all of them are filtered on is_deleted = 0: the application reads
   live rows almost exclusively, so a filtered index is both smaller and a
   stronger hint to the optimiser.
